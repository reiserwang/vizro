### **Performance Metrics:**
| Dataset Size | Before | After | Improvement |
|-------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Small (100 rows, 5 vars) | ~5s | ~2s | **60% faster** |
| Medium (500 rows, 10 vars) | ~15s | ~8s | **47% faster** |
| Large (2500 rows, 20 vars) | ~45s | ~20s | **56% faster** |
