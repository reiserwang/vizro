## üìà Statistical Methods

### Causal Discovery
- **NOTEARS Algorithm**: Non-parametric causal structure learning
- **DAG Validation**: Ensures acyclic graph structure
- **Weight Interpretation**: Positive/negative causal effects with magnitude

### Quality Evaluation
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson and Spearman coefficients
- **Significance Testing**: P-value calculations with 0.05 threshold
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for predictive performance
- **Residual Analysis**: D'Agostino-Pearson normality tests
- **Network Metrics**: Density, sparsity, and complexity measures

### Forecasting Models
- **Linear Regression**: Trend-based predictions with time features
- **ARIMA**: Autoregressive integrated moving average for time series
- **Nowcasting**: Real-time prediction using recent data patterns

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed in the correct environment
2. **Data Loading**: Check file format and encoding (UTF-8 recommended)
3. **Memory Issues**: Large datasets may require data sampling or chunking
4. **Causal Analysis**: Requires at least 2 numeric columns for meaningful results

### Performance Tips
- **Data Size**: Optimal performance with datasets under 10,000 rows
- **Column Selection**: Focus on relevant variables for causal analysis
- **Browser**: Use modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for best experience

## üîÆ Future Works

We are planning to enhance the forecasting capabilities by adding more advanced models from the `statsmodels` library. Here are some of the models we are considering:

*   **Exponential Smoothing (ETS)**: To better handle data with trend and seasonality.
*   **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**: For multivariate time series analysis.
*   **State-Space Models**: To model time series in terms of unobserved states.
*   **Dynamic Factor Models**: To explain a large number of time series with a small number of unobserved common factors.

We also plan to add more features to the causal analysis section, such as:
*   Allowing users to add or remove edges from the causal graph.
*   Implementing what-if analysis to simulate interventions.
