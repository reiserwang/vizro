## Technical Implementation

### **Time-Decay Effects**
- **Strongest impact** at incident start date
- **Gradual decay** over incident duration
- **Decay formula**: `impact * max(0.3, 1 - (months_since_start / duration))`
- **Minimum impact**: 30% of original impact maintained throughout duration

### **Cascading Effects**
1. **Primary Impact**: Incidents directly affect `Sales_Volume`
2. **Revenue Impact**: `Revenue = Price × Sales_Volume` (automatic cascade)
3. **Satisfaction Impact**: Major incidents affect `Customer_Satisfaction`
4. **Training Response**: Negative incidents trigger increased `Training_Hours`
5. **Margin Impact**: Incidents affect `Profit_Margin` through operational efficiency

### **Statistical Properties**
- **46.8% of records** affected by at least one incident
- **Average impact**: -1.6% (slightly negative due to more negative events)
- **Impact range**: -35% to +25%
- **19.9% positive impacts**, **27.0% negative impacts**, **53.2% no impact**

## Business Realism

### **Impact Correlations**
| Metric | Correlation with Incident Impact | P-value | Significance |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------|--------------|
| **Sales Volume** | +0.413 | < 0.001 | *** |
